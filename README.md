## ðŸŒŸ Introduction  
Mental health is a cornerstone of human well-being, yet it often goes unnoticed and untreated. **Sentinel Minds** is a machine learning-powered project designed to predict depression based on multiple lifestyle and demographic factors. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, this project aims to contribute to early detection and awareness of mental health conditions, paving the way for timely intervention.

## ðŸ“‹ Dataset Information  

The dataset contains comprehensive mental health and lifestyle data:  
- **Demographics**: ID, Name, Gender, Age, City  
- **Education & Profession**: Profession, Degree, Working Professional/Student, CGPA  
- **Stress Factors**: Academic/Work Pressure, Financial Stress  
- **Satisfaction Levels**: Study Satisfaction, Job Satisfaction  
- **Health & Lifestyle**: Sleep Duration, Dietary Habits, Family History of Mental Illness  
- **Outcome Variable**: Depression indicator (Yes/No)  

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, ensure consistency, and prepare it for modeling.
